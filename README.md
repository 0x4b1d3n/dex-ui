**The project source code is hosted here for reference.**

**I am currently working on cleaning this up, will likely be more stable by the end of the week.**

The code is a serious mess as I never intended to make this code public. But since so many people are interested, here it is. For the time being I'll just be cleaning up the code and writing documentation, I won't be trying to make this work on other people machines - that part's up to you.

If you look at this before I have cleaned it up, please forgive me. See [Stag](https://github.com/seenaburns/stag) for much better code quality!


What are you looking at
===

This is the code for an [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) project. First step is to get openFrameworks, try it out and see how some of the graphics examples work. Then the code provided here is the source files and shaders needed. However, things like fonts and images are not included, so if you are here to get this running on your own computer you have A LOT of work cut out for you right now.
